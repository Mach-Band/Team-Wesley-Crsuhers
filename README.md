## Our Solution
We offer the society an AI-based solution for segregating Biomedical-waste into color coded bins as per the guidelines of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)


## INTRODUCTION:

Biomedical waste  management refers to the safe disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste (including soiled swabs, dressings, masks, gloves, surgical blades, 
needles, broken glass ampoules etc.) generated in routine clinical practice at the hospitals, clinics and health centres. This is achieved through careful seggregation
at the time of disposal itself, so as to reduce the risk of infection during handling. 

However, careless attitudes and falling awareness among medical professionals, paramedical staff and medical students, along with lack of knowledge and illiteracy 
among patients and their relatives, leads to non-systematic and unseggregated medical waste disposal, which is not only a hazard to the handlers, but also to the 
environment.

## FUTURE SCOPE: 
- The application will be made compulsary for all patients visiting the government hospitals.

- On correct disposal points will be rewarded which can be redeemed against electricity and water bills.

- Each hospital will receive feedback on the proportion of their unseggregated waste, in the form of reminders, warnings and penalties.
